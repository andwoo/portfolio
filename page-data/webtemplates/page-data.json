My biggest hurdle when starting a new personal web project is the repetitive start up boilerplate. Doing the same thing over and over got tiring and occasionally I would give up on an idea because of the set up time it takes to configure a modern web project. Starter projects exist out there but with so many dependencies I sometimes couldn't tell what their use was. These starters tried to cast a wide net to cover many project types. I wanted something minimalist. </p>\n</br>\n<p>I decided to put some time aside and create my own series of starter project targeting different use cases. I started from the ground up and this time I knew what each dependency was used for. Not only is it easy for me to get an idea off the ground, but I have learned a lot from both configuring and maintaining these templates.</p>\n</br>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/andwoo/template-vanilla-scss\">Vanilla Javascript + SCSS</a></br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-scss\">React + SCSS</a></br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-redux-scss\">React + SCSS + Redux</a></br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-redux-scss-asp\">React + SCSS + Redux + ASP.Net Core</a></br></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 04, 2019","logo":"webtemplates/logo.png","path":"/webtemplates","title":"Web Templates","headerTitle":"Web Templates","repos":["https://github.com/andwoo/template-vanilla-scss","https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-scss","https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-redux-scss","https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-redux-scss-asp"],"technologies":["React","Redux","SCSS","Typescript","C#","ASP.NET Core","Docker"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3518672694","454310507","63159454"]}
